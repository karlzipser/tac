To do now:
	-write notes.txt which contains continually updated information on run	
	-udate dataloader
	-test generated images
	-save progress notes
	-make sure I can run in 32x32 and 128x128, maybe 64x64 too
	-make gan discriminator
	
Longer term:
	-save samples for tac_ideal and tac_attn
	-put kllm into tac-style project
	projutils/summarize.py
		summarize runs for a project
			rating
			size
			num files by type
			nepochs

	projutils/runmenu.py
		list runs
		rate runs
		delete runs
		put run path into clipboard
		load run into browser

	rs:
		rs.filter(src='project_tac',min_duration=300) # when calculating duration, ignore .html
		rs.show(i=5)
		rs.star(i=3)
		rs.trash(i=[0,1,2])
		rs.note(i=3,'great example')

Done:
	*use adam optimizer
	*save weights as ‘latest.pth’
	*save current epoch somehow
	*put net project path into params.py
	?test out running project in stand alone manner
	*work on prints to allow output to multiple outs
	*get saving of figures and outputs working on above projects, then run and save complete project html files
	?write document explaining constraints and benefits of using projutils
	√get loss working for test data

	-create branch stable2 for each project
		hiMac~ $ history|grep stable1
		 3133  git checkout -b stable1
		 3139  git commit -m 'stable1'
		 3140  git push -u origin stable1


	-save samples of train and test images
	-develop code to summarize, view, comment on and delete runs
	-get rf model into tac-style project
	-generalize gathering of statistics over time (e.g., F1-scores)
	-figure out way to batch run over different versions of a_local.py
	-save sample
	-axis labels on right side of plots
	-class name on output images
	√ batch size 1
	√ load most recent (actually this has to be the second most recent)
	√ max num samples
